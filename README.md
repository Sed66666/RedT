RedT
=======

RedT is an RDMA-enhanced distributed transaction processing protocol with availability guarantees atop of the opensourced distributed framework Deneva, whose study can be found in the following paper:

    Rachael Harding, Dana Van Aken, Andrew Pavlo, and Michael Stonebraker. 2017.
    An Evaluation of Distributed Concurrency Control. PVLDB 10, 5 (2017), 553â€“564.
    
We evaluate the performance of RedT/Tapir/2PC+Paxos on both YCSB and TPC-C workload, and the currency control algorithm is No-Wait.
