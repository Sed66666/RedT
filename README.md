RedT
=======

RedT is a novel distributed transaction processing protocol that works in heterogeneous networks, it extends two-phase commitment (a.b.a. 2PC) by decomposing
transactions into sub-transactions in terms of the data center granularity, and proposing a pre-write-log mechanism that is able to eliminate the log synchronization in the prepare phase.

We implemented RedT and other baselines in this repository, and the concurrency control algorithm we used was No-wait. For the other baseline, we use the ordinary No-wait. For RedT, we design three implementations using RDMA single-side primitives.RDMA_NO_WAIT is the algorithm that distinguishes between read and write locks, RDMA_NO_WAIT2 does not distinguish between read and write locks, and RDMA_NO_WAIT3 adds lock_owner to each data item. We used RDMA_NO_WAIT3 in the paper.

RedT is atop of the opensourced distributed framework Deneva, whose study can be found in the following paper:

Each branch records a different protocol

- RedT-replicacc: the newest RedT protocol.
- tapir: the tapir protocol
- 2PC-Paxos: the 2PC+Paxos protocol and Early-Prepare+Paxos protocol
- MDCC: the MDCC protocol
- RedT-TCP: RedT without RDMA.
